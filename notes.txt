- Expressivity
    - Compound assignment operators
    - Postfix, prefix increment, decrement
    - Destructuring assignment (showcase with normal variables)
    - Spread syntax (showcase with normal variables)
    - Arrow functions expression
        - Can be used instead of standalone functions
        - Curly braces can be omitted in direct return
        - Brackets can be omitted in case of one parameters
    - for..of, for..in
    - Functional programming inspired functions
        - map
        - filter
- Type checking

- Orthogonality
    - Objects
        - An object is the fundamental non-primitive data types in javascript
        - Collection of data types and functions
        - Prototype chain
        - Literal object
        - Array as object (with a relationship between integer-keyed properties and length property)
        - Function as object (with the additional capability of being callable)
        - Primitives are wrapped in objects when performing actions on them
            - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
    - Functions as first-class objects
        - Functions are also objects
        - Can be assigned to constants, passed to other functions as parameters, returned from other functions
    - Spread syntax in different contexts
        - Merging arrays
        - Merging objects
        - Rest parameters
    - Destructuring assignment in different contexts
        - Iterators
        - Function parameters
    - Spread syntax and destructuring assignment in tandem
- Simplicity
    - `this` keyword
        - `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object
        - Using the `new` operator `this` is bound to an empty object
        - In normal functions `this` is bound to the object before the dot
        - In arrow functions `this` is bound to the enclosing context from which the function was called

    - Different ways of defining variables (let, const, var, none)
    - Different ways of defining a function
        - Traditional function
        - Method
        - Arrow function
        - Arrow function without return in direct return
        - Arrow function without brackets in single parameters
    - Different ways of handling asynchronous code
    - Different ways of accessing/setting object members
        - Member name with/without quotations
        - Keeping/discarding member value when the name and the value are the same
        - Functions
    - Different ways of defining objects
        - Constructor
        - Builder function
        - Object literal
        - Class
- Syntax design
    - Words that have misleading meanings (let, var, const)
    - Optional semicolon
    - Special words as variable names? (not all, for example "arguments")
    - Curly braces?
- Exception handling
    - Exists?
    - Try catch throw?
    - Effect of lack of type safety
